# Road Toll Payment Method
My first dapp made on top of the ethereum blockchain using smart contracts.

With this web decentralised app you can pay your road toll with ether and store the expiration date on the blockchain so it is a secured way to store it.

  

Try the app [here](https://alexszabo08.github.io/RoadTollPayment/).


Install [metamask](https://metamask.io/download.html) to connect to web3.
